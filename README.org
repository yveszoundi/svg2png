#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

It's a simple utility to convert SVG images to PNG via [[https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/][Apache Batik]].

* How is this used?  

This is currently used for custom drawing via [[https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin][jArchi]] scripts ([[https://github.com/yveszoundi/archi-humaneimage][Humane Image scripts]]). For general purposes, it's probably better to integrate Apache Batik [[https://mvnrepository.com/search?q=xmlgraphics+batik][directly]] in your projects.

* What are the Requirements?

- A Java development kit installed ([[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/overview-jdk-installation.html][JDK 7+]])
- [[https://maven.apache.org/][Apache Maven]] for the build

* How to build it?

It is built using standard Apache Maven commands at the root of the project.

#+begin_src shell
mvn package
#+end_src

A fat jar will be created at =target/svgtopng.lib.jar=, relative to the project root folder.
